Description: control and monitor storage systems using S.M.A.R.T.
 The smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl and smartd)
  to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and
  Reporting Technology System (S.M.A.R.T.) built into most modern ATA and SCSI
  hard disks. It is derived from the smartsuite package, and includes support
  for ATA/ATAPI-5 disks. It should run on any modern Linux system.
